🚀 AI-Driven Pothole Detection & Reporting System:

📖 Project Overview:
Road maintenance is crucial for public safety and smart city infrastructure. Potholes not only damage vehicles but also cause accidents, injuries, and high repair costs.
This system introduces a smart AI-powered solution for instant pothole detection, severity estimation, and automated reporting using:
YOLOv8-Seg – Real-time object detection & segmentatio
MiDaS & DPT – Accurate depth estimation
ESRGAN – High-quality image restoration
Point Cloud Analysis – Precise boundary & depth detection
Google Maps API – GPS-based location tracking
XGBoost & ARIMA – Predictive pothole maintenance

💡 Goal: Reduce human effort, improve detection accuracy, prevent road accidents, and help government agencies maintain safer roads.
